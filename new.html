        <h1>Story of rabbit and turtle</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Once upon a time, there was a rabbit and a turtle who decided to have a race. The rabbit, known for its speed, was confident that it would easily win against the slow-moving turtle. As the race began, the rabbit sprinted ahead, leaving the turtle far behind. However, the rabbit soon grew overconfident and decided to take a nap under a tree, thinking it had plenty of time to spare.

            Meanwhile, the turtle continued to plod along steadily, never giving up despite the rabbit's lead. Slowly but surely, the turtle made its way towards the finish line. When the rabbit woke up from its nap and realized the turtle was near the end, it rushed to catch up. But it was too late. The turtle had crossed the finish line, winning the race through perseverance and determination.
            
            The moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race. It's not always about being the fastest or the most talented, but about staying focused, consistent, and never giving up on your goals.
